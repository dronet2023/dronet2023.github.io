              <h2>Call for Papers</h2>
              
                <p align="justify">Robot vehicle platforms, often called “drones”, offer exciting new opportunities for mobile computing. Autonomous cooperative systems, made of intelligent devices (such as drones), may deploy and optimize the network to improve its coverage, build routes and fix network partitions to ensure the best communication performance, reduce energy consumption, and dynamically  respond to detected network problems. Innovative solutions are built upon these drone networking primitives to accomplish cost-effective and wide-ranging  mission-critical applications, including search and rescue, surveillance, 3D-mapping, farmland and construction monitoring, delivery of light-weight objects and products, and video.</p>              
                <p align="justify">DroNet welcomes contributions dealing with all facets of drones as mobile computing platforms, including system aspects, theoretical studies, algorithm and protocol design, as well as requirements, constraints, dependability, and regulations. We are particularly looking for papers reporting on experimental results of deployed systems, summaries of challenges or advancements, measurements, and innovative applications. We welcome in particular also contributions from interdisciplinary teams to present robotic work or applications focusing on the communication networks enabling the efficient control and context-awareness of teams of unmanned autonomous vehicles/systems with an emphasis on civilian and aerial applications, while related work on underwater/space/ground unmanned systems are also invited.</p>

				<b>Title:</b> Firefighter Drones- Low-altitude Fleet of Drones in Forest Fire Management </br>
				<b>Abstract: </b> Commercial and civilian applications of drones are becoming increasingly popular, with current applications in aerial photography, shipping and delivery, precision agriculture, remote sensing, and many more yet to come. UAVs have been increasingly utilized in several search and rescue and disaster monitoring operations to collect data/imagery. The current UAV-based operations often involve a single or multiple remotely-controlled UAVs led by commanders in a ground station or pilots in manned aircraft that can still endanger the life of first responders. The full potential capabilities of UAV technology cannot be utilized unless the drones are used in an autonomous mode. Therefore, the future of drone technology is expected to be dominated by smart, small and low-cost autonomous drones that cooperate and coordinate to perform compound missions such as wildfire management with no or minimal human interventions. In this talk, we discuss some of our recent work related to task allocation, communication, and onboard wildfire detection in a network of autonomous UAVs as well as the datasets of aerial images collected by our team during prescribed fires.</br>
